# knitting_symbols
SVG images of standard stitch symbols used on knitting charts. The primary goal at the moment is to provide SVG images for Japanese kniting symbols, as defined in the JIS L0201 standard and commonly used in Japanese publications. However, I hope to eventually have symbols for other common systems, and contributions are aways welcome!
