# Symbol list

Blank cells indicate symbols that will be included but are not yet. The <span class='bordered'>borders</span> around the symbols are not present in the image files themselves, but are drawn here to approximate the symbolsâ€™ appearance in the context of a stitch chart. However, for symbols that take up more than one cell (such as ![decrease left, 2 cells](../JIS/decreaseleft.2w.svg)), the borders between cells _are_ present in the image file.

Note: the file naming scheme is perhaps a bit strange, because the files are named in the same format as characters in OpenType fonts. Hopefully this will facilitate the eventual production of a font with these symbols.
